## Organization Method

This repository follows the PARA method for knowledge organization:

- **Projects**: Active work with defined timelines and deliverables
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities without specific deadlines (e.g., staff management, compliance)
- **Resources**: Reference materials, guides, and evergreen content
- **Archive**: Completed projects and inactive materials retained for reference

## Usage

### Creating New Notes

1. Determine the appropriate category (Project, Area, Resource, or Archive)
2. Use existing templates from `/templates` directory when applicable
3. Include metadata at the top of each note (creation date, tags, related items)
4. Link related notes using relative file paths

### Task Management

- Active tasks are tracked in `/to-do` directory
- Use clear, actionable language for task descriptions
- Include priority levels and due dates where applicable
- Move completed tasks to archive with completion date

## Conventions

- **File naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `project-name-notes.md`)
- **Dates**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Tags**: Use consistent hashtags for cross-referencing (#healthcare, #compliance, #property)
- **Links**: Relative paths for internal references

## Maintenance

- Weekly review of active projects and tasks
- Monthly archiving of completed items
- Quarterly cleanup of outdated resources

## Tools

This repository is designed to work with:
- Any markdown editor
- Git for version control and sync
- Text search tools for quick reference retrieval
